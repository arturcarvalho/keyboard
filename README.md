# keyboard

- The F keys have priority
- I'm not using a specific layer for windows. Press the M2 to toggle between layer 2 and 0. (layer 2 is the numpad layer for the moment)

- M5 / go to line on vscode / ctrl + g
- M15 / cmd+space / now used for the moment
- Double ctrl. For the moment there are 2 controls to the left. Still not sure what to do here, but for the moment it will work like this.
